This is a weather application, built using SwiftUI.

The app fetches weather and forecast data from openweather api. (https://openweathermap.org/api)

On launching the app for the first time, it asks permission to access the device location. On recieving the permission, the app fetches the weather and forecast data for the current location.

The location of my emulator is set to San Fransisco, hence the city name. 
The star icon on the top left corner of the screen is a button used to add a city to favourites list.
The screen shows various weather information bits.
The button at the bottom of the screen that says "Get Forecast" is used to fetch forecast data for the city loaded.
